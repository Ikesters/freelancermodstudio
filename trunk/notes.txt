So what can it do?
It is intended to be (at the very end) an all-in-one modding solution for Freelancer. Freelancer Mod Studio is written in C# and will be open source, therefor can be continued by anyone.

Help?
I need every help I can get from you but especially from programmers otherwise I wont have enought time and the program will never be finished.
